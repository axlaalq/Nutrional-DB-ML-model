# Nutritional Database and Diet Recommendation Model

This project aims to create a comprehensive nutritional database of various foods and develop a machine learning model capable of recommending personalized diets based on individual requirements and objectives.  The project encompasses data collection, database creation, model training, and a user-friendly interface for diet recommendations.

## Project Contents

### Data Collection and Database Creation

* Gathering nutritional information from reliable sources (e.g., USDA FoodData Central API, other reputable databases, scientific publications).
* Designing and implementing a relational database (e.g., using PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store food data, including:
    * Price
    * Food name and description
    * Serving size
    * Macronutrient breakdown (calories, protein, carbohydrates, fats)
* Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data consistency and accuracy.  This includes handling missing values and standardizing units.
* Implementing efficient data retrieval and querying mechanisms.

### Machine Learning Model Development (code on process)

* Feature engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant nutritional features for model input.
* Model selection: Exploring and comparing different machine learning algorithms suitable for diet recommendation (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid approaches).
* Training the chosen model on the nutritional database and potentially user data (if available).
* Model evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., precision, recall, RMSE) and refining it iteratively.
* Incorporating user preferences and constraints:  Allowing users to specify dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, allergies), health conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension), and fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain).

### Diet Recommendation System (code on process)

* Developing a user interface for interacting with the system using python and kivymd 2.0.1.dev0.
* Implementing the diet recommendation logic:  Using the trained machine learning model to generate personalized diet plans based on user input.
* Providing detailed nutritional information for recommended meals and recipes.
* Allowing users to track their dietary intake and progress.
* Potential integration with other health and fitness tracking apps.

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL 
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (for machine learning), Flask/Django (for web application development), PostgreSQL/MySQL (for database)
* **Other Tools:**  Version control (Git), Supabase


## Future Development

* Expanding the food database with more comprehensive nutritional information.
* Incorporating user feedback to improve the accuracy and personalization of diet recommendations.
* Adding more advanced features, such as meal planning, recipe generation, and integration with wearable devices.
* Exploring different machine learning models and optimization techniques to enhance performance.
* Deploying the system to a production environment for wider accessibility.
